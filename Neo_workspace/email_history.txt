Dear Dr. Shaofei Cai,

My name is Yung Chen Chiang (江咏宸), and I am currently a master’s student at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan. I am conducting research on embodied agents and have chosen MineStudio as the target environment.

I have followed the MineStudio tutorial and installed it on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, running under Windows WSL. However, I encountered an issue where no display window appears when I run any script. Despite this, I noticed that a recording file named episode_1.mp4 is generated in the output directory.

I have attempted to resolve the issue using both Xvfb and VirtualGL(NVIDIA 3090Ti installed on my computer), but unfortunately, neither approach has worked. I have attached the relevant execution logs and summarization of logs below for your reference.

I would be sincerely grateful if you could provide any guidance or suggestions to help me resolve this display problem.

Thank you very much for your time and support.

Warm regards,
Yung Chen Chiang
National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan
